# Deprecated Docker

**TODO** These instructions still need to be reviewed / updated.

If you would prefer to use Docker (or your computer does not support VirtualBox) follow this guide.

1. Download Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

1. Run:

   ```bash
   docker pull thecharlesjenkins/robojackets-software-training
   ```

1. Run

   ```bash
   docker run  --rm -p 6080:80 -p 6081:443 --mount source=rj-training-home,destination=/home/padowan --mount source=rj-training-usr,destination=/usr -e USER=padowan -e PASSWORD=robojackets --name training thecharlesjenkins/robojackets-software-training -h training
   ```

1. Navigate to `localhost:6080` in your browser and wait (it may take a while).

1. Start training! You will also have access to the repos for robonav, roboracing, and robocup.

1. Anytime password is needed fill in with `robojackets` or whatever you put as the argument to the environment variable in step 3.

If the above does not work on you computer, you can replace steps 2 through 3 above with these:

2. Run 

   ```bash
   docker pull thecharlesjenkins/robojackets-software-training:m1
   ```

1. Run

   ```bash
   docker run  --rm -p 5900:5900 --mount source=rj-training-home,destination=/home/padowan --mount source=rj-training-usr,destination=/usr -e USER=padowan -e PASSWORD=robojackets --name training thecharlesjenkins/robojackets-software-training:m1 -h training
   ```

1. Use a VNC viewer to navigate to localhost:5900. On Safari you can do `vnc://localhost:5900`
