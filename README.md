# RoboJackets Software Training (Advanced)

This repository contains the former RoboJackets software training content.
It is NOT required for new RoboJackets software members, but can serve as a very helpful resource for learning about various topics in ROS2, C++ and Robotics Theory.

The syllabus for training can be found [here](Syllabus.md).

For student computer setup instructions, go to the [setup_instructions folder](./setup_instructons/readme.md).
