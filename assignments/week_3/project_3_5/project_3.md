# Exercise 1.2
Welcome to your second exercise of RoboJackets software training! This exercise will be testing your knowledge of basic C++ syntax and vector manipulation. For this exercise we expect you to have watched or know the content of the Codecademy C++ course up through vectors.

# Exercise Objective
In this exercise, you will be reversing an vector and checking if a string is a palindrome. The purpose of this exercise is to get you familar with working with vectors and strings. This exercise should help solidify your knowledge of loops, variables, conditionals, and vectors. _We aren't going to be using any new C++ standard library functions in the instructions, but feel free to use them if you want._

# Starting Code
We have already given you a `main()` function to write your code in and have included the proper libraries for you to use. We have also set up most of variable initilization and commented where you will write your code.


### Part 1: Vector Reversal
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    // Part 1: Vector Reversal

    // Input vector from command-line
    std::vector<int> list;
    int input = 0;
    std::cout << "Input List Of Numbers (end list with non-integer):" << std::endl;
    while (std::cin >> input)
    {
        list.push_back(input);
    }

    // Print original vector
    std::cout << "Original Vector: ";
    for (int v : list)
    {
        std::cout << v << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Reverse Vector
    // WRITE YOUR VECTOR REVERSAL HERE

    // Print the Reversed vector
    std::cout << "Reversed Vector: ";
    for (int v : list)
    {
        std::cout << v << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

1. Create variables for the vector's `start` and `end` indices
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    int start = 0;
    int end = list.size() - 1;
  ```

</details>

2. Create a loop which continues as long as `start` is less than `end`
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    while (start < end)
    {
        // MORE CODE
    }
  ```

</details>

3. In the loop, increment `start` and decrement `end` so that `start` will iterate forwards over the first half and `end` will iterate backwards over the second half
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    while (start < end)
    {
        // MORE CODE

        start++;
        end--;
    }
  ```

</details>

4. In the loop, swap the elements at `start` and `end` with each other so `list[start]` -> `list[end]` and `list[end]` -> `list[start]`
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    while (start < end)
    {
        int temp = list[start];
        list[start] = list[end];
        list[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
  ```

</details>

##### Expected Output
_Note: Make sure you end your list of integers with a non-interger character (in these examples we are using '.')_ <br>
**Example**:
  - **Input**: 1 2 3 4 5 .
  - **Output**: 5 4 3 2 1

  - **Input**: 4 3 5 6 9 .
  - **Output**: 9 6 5 3 4

Now try to run the program and test that the vector gets reversed!


### Part 2: Palindrome Check
A **palindrome** is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward (such as _madam_ and _racecar_). Therefore, a string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // Part 2: Palindrome Check

    // Input string from command-line
    std::string str;
    std::cout << "Enter String:" << std::endl;
    std::cin >> str;

    // Palindrome Check
    // WRITE YOUR PALINDROME CHECK HERE

    return 0;
}
```

1. Create variables for the string's leftmost and rightmost indices (`left` and `right`)
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    int left = 0;
    int right = str.length() - 1;
  ```

</details>

2. Create a variable (`is_palindrome`) that will store the result of the palindrome check
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    bool is_palindrome = true;
  ```

</details>

3. Create a loop which continues as long as `left` is less than `right`
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    while (left < right)
    {
        // MORE CODE
    }
  ```

</details>

4. In the loop, check if the elements at `left` and `right` in the string are different
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    while (left < right)
    {
        if (str[left] != str[right])
        {
            // MORE CODE
        }
    }
  ```

</details>

5. If the characters are different, you should set `is_palindrome` to false and leave the loop.
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    while (h > l)
    {
        if (str[l] != str[h])
        {
            is_palindrome = false;
            break;
        }
    }
  ```

</details>

6. In the loop, increment `left` and decrement `right` so that `left` will iterate forwards over the first half and `right` will iterate backwards over the second half
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    while (left < right)
    {
        if (str[left] != str[right])
        {
            is_palindrome = false;
            break;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
  ```

</details>

7. Print out the results (ex. <str\> is (NOT) a palindrome)
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```c++
    if (is_palindrome)
    {
        std::cout << str << " is a palindrome" << std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << str << " is NOT a palindrome" << std::endl;
    }
  ```

</details>

##### Expected Output
**Example**:
  - **Input**: abcdcba
  - **Output**: abcdcba is a palindrome

  - **Input**: pineapple
  - **Output**: pineapple is NOT a palindrome

Now run the program and test multiple strings to check your program works!

# Review
Great Job! You successfully manipulated a vector and string in this exercise. Although, these instructions explain one method to do vector reversal and palindrome checking, there are much easier ways to do these operations using C++ standard library functions.

For example, [`std::reverse()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/reverse) lets you easily reverse any standard container.

```c++
std::reverse(list.begin(), list.end());
```

For palindrome checking, there are multiple one-line solutions using the standard library features. Standard containers (including `std::string`) have reverse iterators that let you iterate over the container in reverse order. So the palindrome check could be written like this:

```c++
bool is_palindrome = ( str == string(str.rbegin(), str.rend()) );
```

Or even in a way that's generic for any standard container:

```c++
bool is_palindrome = std::equal(str.begin(), str.begin() + str.size()/2, str.rbegin());
```

Checkout [`std::string::rbegin()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/rbegin) and [`std::string::rend()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/rend) for documentation.

The standard library is a powerful tool for writing C++ code. As you progress through future weeks' exercises, you'll become more and more familiar with it!
