* What You Know
- ~git status~
- ~git add~
- ~git commit~
- ~git remote~
- ~git pull~
- ~git push~
- /(any questions?)/

* Some Problems
- Multiple developers work on the same code, at the same time
- We want to maintain multiple versions of the same software in parallel
  - How do I apply a security fix to an old version?
- You want a safe place to test out changes, without affecting anyone else
- Branching is ~git~'s solution

* Branches
- Branches are local copies of state
- If you do work on a branch, it won't affect any other branches
- Later on, we can 'merge' branches together (so work done on either can be combined).
- Branches are what people have the most trouble with
  - _*Ask questions /please/!*_ This is a difficult topic.

** Git As a Graph

- git history is a *graph*
- Each commit is a node on the graph
- Ways to see it as a graph, rather than a line of commits
  - ~git~ porcelain
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports results
      git log --oneline --graph --decorate | head -n9
    #+END_SRC
  - ~gitk~
  - ~git~ integrations for your favorite editor!

** Creating Branches
- Let's start by creating multiple branches

  #+BEGIN_SRC
    844a162 * master stable beta Initial commit
  #+END_SRC

- We have one commit and 3 branches point to the same commit
  - master, stable, beta
- Right now, everything is at the same state
- Create branches with

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    # git branch <BRANCH_NAME>

    # Create two branches, starting from the current commit

    git branch stable
    git branch beta
  #+END_SRC

** Switching Branches

- Only one branch can be checked out at a time
- ~git status~ will display info on your current branch
- ~git checkout~ lets you switch between branches
- Let's checkout the *stable* branch now
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git status
    #> On branch master
    #> nothing to commit, working tree clean

    # git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>

    git checkout stable
    #> Switched to branch 'stable

    git status
    #> On branch stable
    #> nothing to commit, working tree clean
  #+END_SRC

** First Stable Commit
- Let's add a commit to the stable branch
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    echo "Stability counts!" > stable_release.txt
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Add stable_release.txt"
  #+END_SRC
- This will *not affect* any other branches
- The other branches will stay behind on 'initial commit'
  #+BEGIN_SRC
    5592388 * stable      Add stable_release.txt
    844a162 * master beta Initial commit
  #+END_SRC

** First Beta Commit
- Let's make a experimental commit on the beta branch
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git checkout beta
    echo "This feature is unstable!" > beta_release.txt
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Add beta_release.txt"
  #+END_SRC
- Since the beta branch was *behind* the stable branch, this creates a 'fork' in the commit history
- Notice, master has not moved at all (since no commits have been made on it)
  #+BEGIN_SRC
    1c65f7b * beta Add beta_release.txt
    5592388 | * stable Add stable_release.txt
            |/
    844a162 * master Initial commit
  #+END_SRC
- Play around and checkout the various branches!
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git checkout <BRANCH>
    ls
  #+END_SRC

** Let's make beta official
- Let's bring the hard work from the beta branch onto the stable branch
- Right now, the stable and the beta branch have 'forked'
- We need to bring them back together, this is called a *merge*
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    # Checkout to the branch we want to merge **into** aka the "base branch"
    git checkout stable
    # Merge the branch we want (beta) into the current branch (stable)
    git merge beta
    # This will launch an editor, save and quit it to complete
  #+END_SRC
- This does not change any other branch
  #+BEGIN_SRC
    ddc2df9 *   stable Merge branch 'beta' into stable
            |\
    1c65f7b | * beta Add beta_release.txt
    5592388 * | Add stable_release.txt
            |/
    844a162 * master Initial commit
  #+END_SRC

** Remotes vs Branches vs Forks
- A fork or clone does a full copy of the git repo
- A remote is a pointer to another copy of this git repo
- A repository is a collection of *branches*
- You can only directly modify local branches, but:
  - You can merge from a remote into your branch (pull)
  - You can merge from your branch to a remote (push)

* Pull requests
- A pull request (PR) is a request for a project owner to merge a branch from your fork into their repository
  #+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
            push         PR
    laptop -----> fork -----> upstream
      ^            |             |
      |            v             v
      |---------------------------
               pull
  #+END_SRC
- Request an owner to merge *from a branch on your fork*

** How to make a pull request
- Push code locally stored on your computer to your fork on GitHub
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git push origin stable
  #+END_SRC
- Locate your fork on GitHub and click "New pull request"

** How to make a pull request (continued)
- Ensure that both repos and branches are correct
- Click "Create pull request"

* Overall Contribution Flow
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # start on master
  git checkout master

  # Ensure we branch off from a recent version
  git pull rj master

  # create a new branch
  git branch my-new-feature
  git checkout my-new-feature

  # Add commits with your work
  git commit -m "Fix all of RoboJackets"

  # push to a seperate branch on your fork
  git push origin my-new-feature

  # Go to github, and click 'new pull request'

  # add updates by
  git commit -m "Add missing files"
  git push origin my-new-feature
#+END_SRC
